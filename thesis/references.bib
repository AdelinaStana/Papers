abstract="When following architecture-driven strategies to develop large software-intensive systems, the analysis of the dependencies is not an easy task. In this paper, we report a systematic literature review on dependency analysis solutions. Dependency analysis concerns making dependencies due to interconnections between programs or system components explicit. The review is practice-driven because its research questions, execution, and reporting were influenced by the practice of a group of software architects at Philips Healthcare MRI. The review results in an overview and assessment of the state-of-the-art and applicability of dependency analysis. The overview provides insights about definitions related to dependency analysis, the sort of development activities that need dependency analysis, and the classification and description of a number of dependency analysis solutions. The contribution of this paper is for both practitioners and researchers. They can take it as a reference to learn about dependency analysis, match their own practice to the presented results, and to build similar overviews of other techniques and methods for other domains or types of systems.",

abstract="Change coupling is an implicit relationship observed when artifacts change together during software evolution. The literature leverages change coupling analysis for several purposes. For example, researchers discovered that change coupling is associated with software defects and reveals relationships between software artifacts that cannot be found by scanning code or documentation. In this paper, we empirically investigate the strongest change couplings from the Apache Aries project to characterize and identify their impact in software development. We used historical and social metrics collected from commits and issue reports to build classification models to identify strong change couplings. Historical metrics were used because change coupling is a phenomenon associated with recurrent co-changes found in the software history. In turn, social metrics were used because developers often interact with each other in issue trackers to accomplish the tasks. Our classification models showed high accuracy, with 70−99 {\%} F-measure and 88−99 {\%} AUC. Using the same set of metrics, we also predicted the number of future defects for the artifacts involved in strong change couplings. More specifically, we were able to predict 45.7 {\%} of defects where these strong change couplings reoccurred in the post-release. These findings suggest that developers and projects managers should detect and monitor strong change couplings, because they can be associated with defects and tend to happen again in the subsequent release.",

abstract="Coupling is an important property of software systems, which directly impacts program comprehension. In addition, the strength of coupling measured between modules in software is often used as a predictor of external software quality attributes such as changeability, ripple effects of changes and fault-proneness. This paper presents a new set of coupling measures for Object-Oriented (OO) software systems measuring conceptual coupling of classes. Conceptual coupling is based on measuring the degree to which the identifiers and comments from different classes relate to each other. This type of relationship, called conceptual coupling, is measured through the use of Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. The proposed measures are different from existing coupling measures and they capture new dimensions of coupling, which are not captured by the existing coupling measures. The paper investigates the use of the conceptual coupling measures during change impact analysis. The paper reports the findings of a case study in the source code of the Mozilla web browser, where the conceptual coupling metrics were compared to nine existing structural coupling metrics and proved to be better predictors for classes impacted by changes.",

abstract="After a software system has been delivered, it inevitably has to change to remain useful. Evolutionary coupling measures the change dependencies between software components. Reference coupling measures the architecture dependencies between software components. In this paper, we present a method to correlate evolutionary coupling and reference coupling. We study the evolution of 597 consecutive versions of Linux and measure the evolutionary coupling and reference coupling among 12 kernel modules. We compare 12 pairs of evolutionary coupling data and reference coupling data. The results show that linear correlation exists between evolutionary coupling and reference coupling. We conclude that in Linux, the dependencies between software components induced via the system architecture have noticeable effects on kernel module co-evolution.",

Researchers mine the information stored in GitHub's event logs to understand how its users employ the site to collaborate on software, but so far there have been no studies describing the quality and properties of the available GitHub data. We document the results of an empirical study aimed at understanding the characteristics of the repositories and users in GitHub; we see how users take advantage of GitHub's main features and how their activity is tracked on GitHub and related datasets to point out misalignment between the real and mined data. Our results indicate that while GitHub is a rich source of data on software development, mining GitHub for research purposes should take various potential perils into consideration. For example, we show that the majority of the projects are personal and inactive, and that almost 40 {\%} of all pull requests do not appear as merged even though they were. Also, approximately half of GitHub's registered users do not have public activity, while the activity of GitHub users in repositories is not always easy to pinpoint. We use our identified perils to see if they can pose validity threats; we review selected papers from the MSR 2014 Mining Challenge and see if there are potential impacts to consider. We provide a set of recommendations for software engineering researchers on how to approach the data in GitHub.",

abstract = {Context
Software maintenance is burdened by program comprehension activities which consume a big part of project resources. Program comprehension is difficult because the code to be analyzed is very large and the documentation may not be well structured to help navigating through the code.
Objective
Tools should support the early stages of program comprehension. Our goal is to build tools that analyze the code and filter this large amount of information such that only the most important information is presented to the software maintenance team. In the case of object-oriented systems, finding the important information means finding the most important classes, also called the key classes of the system.
Method
In this work, we formulate and explore several hypotheses regarding which are the class attributes that characterize important classes. By class attributes, we understand here different metrics that quantify properties of the class such as its connections and relationships with other classes. All the necessary input data for computing class attributes are extracted from code by static analysis. We experimentally investigate which attributes are best suited to rank classes according to their importance, doing an extensive empirical study on fifteen software systems.
Result
Attributes from the categories of direct connections and network centrality are the best for finding key classes. We identified three class attributes which are best as class ranking criteria: PR-U2-W and CONN-TOTAL-W when the target set of key classes is small and CONN-TOTAL when the target set has a large and variable size. We show that the method of ranking classes based on these attributes outperforms known related work approaches of finding key classes.
Conclusions
Our method allows us to build easy-to-use fully automatic tools which find almost instantly the key classes of a software system starting from its code.}

But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

abstract = {Identifying key classes can help developers familiarize with a previously unknown software system. Complex network research opens new opportunities for identifying key classes, and many approaches have been proposed. However, the software network that existing approaches rely on is un-weighted and un-directed, which does not conform to the reality of a software system. Thus, how to identify key classes by using more accurate software network models and appropriate complex network theories is still a problem that has never been reported. The objective of this paper is to provide a ranked list of classes for new developers as starting points for the program comprehension process. Our approach is based on a more accurate software network and a generalized version of k-core decomposition in complex network research. First, we use a weighted directed software network to represent the topological structure of software at the class level, which takes into consideration both the coupling direction and coupling strength. Then, we propose a generalized k-core decomposition method and use it to calculate the generalized coreness of each class. Finally, we sort classes with respect to their generalized corenesses in a descending order. The top-ranked classes serve as the key class candidates. Experiments have been performed on four open-source software systems. }

As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six “real world” medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for “single number” evaluation of machine learning algorithms.}

abstract = { A class diagram of a software system enhances our ability to understand software design. However, this diagram is often unavailable. Developers usually reconstruct the diagram by reverse engineering it from source code. Unfortunately, the resultant diagram is often very cluttered; making it difficult to learn anything valuable from it. Thus, it would be very beneficial if we are able to condense the reverse- engineered class diagram to contain only the important classes depicting the overall design of a software system. Such diagram would make program understanding much easier. A class can be important, for example, if its removal would break many connections between classes. In our work, we estimate this kind of importance by using design (e.g., number of attributes, number of dependencies, etc.) and network metrics (e.g., betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, etc.). We use these metrics as features and input their values to our optimistic classifier that will predict if a class is important or not. Different from standard classification, our newly proposed optimistic classification technique deals with data scarcity problem by optimistically assigning labels to some of the unlabeled data and use them for training a better statistical model. We have evaluated our approach to condense reverse-engineered diagrams of 9 software systems and compared our approach with the state-of-the-art work of Osman et al. Our experiments show that our approach can achieve an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) score of 0.825, which is a 9.1% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art approach. },

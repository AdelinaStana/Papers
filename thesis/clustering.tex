\label{cap:architectural_reconstruction}


\hspace{4em}In this chapter, we explore using logical dependencies as input for software clustering aimed at architectural reconstruction. Since structural dependencies are the most commonly used in software clustering, we investigate whether integrating them with logical dependencies produces better results than using either dependency type alone.

Our experiments are conducted on four open-source Java projects from GitHub. We apply three distinct clustering algorithms for each project: Louvain, Leiden, and DBSCAN. We evaluate the performance of these algorithms using two clustering evaluation metrics, allowing us to compare the clustering results based solely on logical dependencies with those obtained by integrating both logical and structural dependencies \cite{cluster-access}.


\section{Introduction and research questions}
\label{sec:introduction_clustering}

\hspace{4em} Software systems often need more documentation. Even if there was original documentation at the beginning of development, it may become outdated over the years. Additionally, the original developers may leave the company, taking with them knowledge about how the software was designed. This situation challenges the teams when it comes to maintenance or modernization. In this context, recovering the system's architecture is essential. Understanding the system's architecture helps developers evaluate better and understand the nature and impact of changes they must make. One technique to help in reconstructing the system architecture is software clustering. Software clustering involves creating cohesive groups (modules) of software entities based on their dependencies and interactions.

Among the dependencies that can be used for software clustering are structural dependencies (relationships between entities based on code analysis), lexical dependencies (relationships based on naming conventions), and code co-changes/logical dependencies (relationships between entities extracted from the version control system), and others \cite{b15, DBLP:journals/jss/AjienkaC17}.

This chapter assesses the impact of logical dependencies in software clustering alone and combination with structural dependencies. The following research questions guide our investigation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} Does using structural dependencies (SD) combined with logical dependencies (LD) improve software clustering results compared to traditional approaches using only structural dependencies (SD)?
\item \textbf{RQ2:} Can using only logical dependencies (LD) produce good software clustering results?
\item \textbf{RQ3:} How do different filtering settings for logical dependencies (LD) impact clustering results, and which filtering settings provide the best performance?
\end{itemize}

To answer these research questions, we apply three different clustering algorithms (Louvain, Leiden, and DBSCAN) to different open-source projects. We then evaluate the results using two metrics: MQ (Modularization Quality) \cite{b10} and MoJoFM (Move and Join e\textbf{F}fectiveness \textbf{M}easure) \cite{mojofm}. The MoJoFM metric is used for external evaluation, evaluating against the perspective of the system's architect or developers. The MQ metric is used for internal evaluation based on the software structure itself. These two metrics allow us to compare the effectiveness of using structural and logical dependencies alone and combined. This comparison helps clarify how different dependencies and filtering choices affect clustering results.



\section{Methodology and implementation}
\label{sec:methodology_implementation}

\hspace{4em}In this section, we present the methodology used to evaluate the impact of logical dependencies on the quality of software clustering solutions.

First, we describe the clustering algorithms used in our experiments: Louvain, Leiden, and DBSCAN. Next, we introduce the evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of the clustering results. Finally, we present the workflow and implementation of the tool developed for this research, which is built to process structural and logical dependencies, apply the selected clustering algorithms, and compute the evaluation metrics.

\subsection{Clustering algorithms}
\subsubsection{Louvain}
\label{subsubsec:louvain}

\hspace{4em}The Louvain algorithm was originally developed by Blondel et al. and is used to find community partitions (clusters) in large networks. The algorithm begins with a weighted network of N nodes, initially assigning each node to its own cluster, resulting in N clusters. For each node, the algorithm evaluates the modularity gained from moving the node to the cluster of each of its neighbors. Based on the results, the node is moved to the cluster with the maximum positive modularity gain. This process is repeated for all nodes until no further improvement in modularity is possible \cite{b8}, \cite{b9}.

\subsubsection{Leiden}
\label{subsubsec:leiden}

\hspace{4em}The Leiden algorithm, developed by Traag et al., is an improvement over the Louvain algorithm for community detection in large networks. Like Louvain, the Leiden algorithm begins with each node assigned to its own cluster and iteratively moves nodes between clusters to optimize modularity. However, the Leiden algorithm addresses some problems of the Louvain method, particularly regarding poorly connected communities and runtime performance issues \cite{leiden} \cite{scikit}.

The Leiden algorithm introduces a refinement phase that ensures communities are locally optimally clustered and well-connected. This refinement step distinguishes the Leiden algorithm from Louvain \cite{cluster-access}.


\subsubsection{DBSCAN}
\label{subsubsec:dbscan}

\hspace{4em}The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, introduced by Ester et al., is a density-based clustering algorithm for identifying clusters of arbitrary shape and detecting noise in data \cite{dbscan}, \cite{scikit}.

DBSCAN operates based on two main parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Eps}: It defines the radius within which to search for neighboring points.
\item \textbf{MinPts}: The minimum number of points required for a dense region. It determines the minimum number of neighbors a point should have to be considered a core point.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm classifies points into three categories:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Core Points}: Points that have at least \textit{MinPts} neighbors within a radius of \textit{Eps}. These points are located in the interior of a cluster.
\item \textbf{Border Points}: Points that have fewer than \textit{MinPts} neighbors within a radius of \textit{Eps} but are in the Eps-neighborhood of a core point. They are located on the edge of a cluster.
\item \textbf{Noise}: Points that are neither core points nor border points.
\end{enumerate}

The DBSCAN algorithm starts by visiting an arbitrary point in the dataset. If the point is a core point, the algorithm starts a new cluster and retrieves all reachable points from this core point. All points are then marked as part of the cluster. If the point is a border point, it moves to the next point in the dataset. This process is repeated until all points have been visited.

DBSCAN can be applied for software clustering by considering software entities as data points. A distance measure based on dependency weights can be used to compute the neighborhood between entities.

\subsection{Clustering result evaluation}
\label{subsec:evaluation_def}

\hspace{4em}We evaluate the clustering results using two metrics: the Modularity Quality (MQ) metric and the Move and Join Effectiveness Measure (MoJoFM) metric. Each provides a different perspective on the quality of the clustering solutions.

\subsubsection{Modularity Quality metric}
\label{subsec:mq}

\hspace{4em}Mancoridis et al. introduced the Modularity Quality (MQ) metric to evaluate the modularization quality of a clustering solution based on the interaction between modules (clusters) \cite{b10}. It evaluates the difference between connections within clusters and connections between different clusters.

The MQ of a graph partitioned into \( k \) clusters, where \( A_i \) is the Intra-Connectivity of the \( i \)-th cluster and \( E_{ij} \) is the Inter-Connectivity between the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th clusters, is calculated using Equation \eqref{eq:mq} \cite{b2}.

\begin{equation}
MQ = \left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^{k} A_i \right) - \left( \frac{1}{k(k-1)} \sum_{i,j=1}^{k} E_{ij} \right)
\label{eq:mq}
\end{equation}

The MQ metric's value ranges between -1 and 1. A value of -1 means that the clusters have more connections between the clusters than within the clusters, while a value of 1 means that there are more connections within clusters than between clusters. A good clustering solution should have an MQ value close to 1, since this indicates that the clusters are more cohesive internally and have fewer connections to other clusters.

The MQ metric is useful because it does not require additional input besides the clustering result. It relies on the structure of the clustered entities and their interactions.

\subsubsection{MoJoFM metric}
\label{subsec:mojofm}
\hspace{4em}Wen and Tzerpos introduced the MoJoFM metric to evaluate the similarity between two different software clustering results \cite{mojofm}. The metric is based on the MoJo metric, which measures the absolute minimum number of \textit{Move} and \textit{Join} operations required to transform one clustering solution into another \cite{b3}, \cite{mojofm}. However, MoJoFM provides a similarity measure ranging between 0\% and 100\%, where 100\% indicates identical clustering solutions.

The MoJoFM metric is calculated using Equation \eqref{eq:mojofm}:

\begin{equation}
\text{MoJoFM}(A, B) = \left(1 - \frac{\text{mno}(A, B)}{\max(\text{mno}(\forall A, B))}\right) \times 100\%
\label{eq:mojofm}
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\text{mno}(A, B)$ is the minimum number of \textit{Move} and \textit{Join} operations required to transform clustering solution $A$ into clustering solution $B$.
\item $\max(\text{mno}(\forall A, B))$ is the maximum possible number of such operations required to transform any clustering $A$ into clustering $B$.
\end{itemize}

To use the metric, we first need to generate a reference clustering solution for comparison. We manually created this reference based on our analysis of the codebase.

Using the MoJoFM metric, we can evaluate the similarity between the generated and reference clustering solutions. This metric is useful when combining multiple dependencies because it measures the similarity between the obtained clustering solutions and the same reference.


\subsection{Tool workflow for software clustering and evaluation}
\label{subsec:tool_workflow}


\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{workflow-tool.png}
  \caption{ Tool workflow overview: input, processing and output.}
  \label{fig:tool}
\end{figure}

\hspace{4em}To evaluate how logical dependencies impact the quality of clustering solutions, we developed an additional Python tool. This tool can process any dependency alone or combined with other types if the data is provided in CSV format. The tool performs software clustering and evaluates clustering solutions using the MQ or MoJoFM metrics.



\subsubsection{Input}

\hspace{4em}The tool takes one or multiple dependency CSV files as input and the reference solution required for the MoJoFM metric. We designed the tool to accept multiple dependency files so that we can generate clustering solutions based on either a single type of dependency (structural or logical) or a combination of both.

Since the MoJoFM metric requires a reference solution to evaluate the obtained clustering solutions, we manually inspected the code and created reference clustering solutions, which we then provided as input for the tool.

\subsubsection{Processing}

\hspace{4em}The dependencies are saved in the CSV file in the following format: \texttt{antecedent of a dependency, consequent of a dependency, weight}. The tool reads each line, adds the antecedent and consequent as nodes in a directed graph, and creates an edge between them, with the weight from the CSV file becoming the edge weight. The edge weights are summed if multiple dependency files are processed and the same dependency is found in multiple files.

The workflow of applying the clustering algorithms and performing the evaluations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tool}. After all dependencies are read, the directed graph is passed to the clustering algorithms: Louvain, Leiden, and DBSCAN. Each algorithm generates its own clustering result. The results from each algorithm are then evaluated using the MQ metric and the MoJoFM metric. The MQ metric requires the directed graph and the clustering result, while the MoJoFM metric requires the reference clustering solution provided as input and the clustering result.


\subsubsection{Output}

\hspace{4em}After applying each clustering algorithm and completing both evaluations, we export the clustering result, the number of clusters from the clustering solution, and the MQ and MoJoFM metrics values \cite{cluster-access}.

\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

\hspace{4em}In Table \ref{tab:project_info}, we have synthesized all the information about the four projects used in our experiments. The 'Project Name' column contains the names of the software projects sourced from GitHub. The 'Release Tag' column contains the specific release tag of the project that was analyzed. We processed all the commits for logical dependency extraction, from the first commit to the commit associated with the specified tag. We extracted the dependencies from the code of that specific tag for structural dependencies. The 'Number of Commits' column provides the total number of commits used for logical dependencies extraction. The 'GitHub Repository Link' column includes the URL link to the project's repository on GitHub. Finally, the 'Repository Description' column briefly describes the project's purpose and functionality.

We mainly chose projects with more than 10,000 commits in their commit history so that the logical dependencies extraction can be done on a more extensive information base. However, we selected Gson, which has a relatively small commit history (1,772 commits), to determine if our experiments work with a smaller information base.

Table \ref{tab:commit_statistics} presents the commit statistics for the studied projects. The columns represent the percentage of commits with under 5 files modified, between 5 and 10 files, between 10 and 20 files, and above 20 files modified. We can observe that most commits have under 5 files changed, with Apache Tomcat having more than 90\% of the commits with less than 5 files changed. On the opposite side, only a few commits involve more than 20 files changed, Hibernate ORM having the highest percentage at 8.39\% \cite{cluster-access}.

\section{Experimental plan and results}
\label{sec:experiment}


\subsection{Experimental plan}
\label{subsec:plan}

\hspace{4em}To assess the impact of logical dependencies and to answer the research questions from section \ref{sec:introduction_clustering}, we run the tool presented in Section \ref{subsec:tool_workflow} in three different scenarios for all the projects from table \ref{tab:project_info}. All three scenarios are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:scenatrio}.

In the first scenario, we run the tool once, providing only the system's structural dependencies as input for the clustering algorithm.

In the second scenario, we run the tool ten times, using only logical dependencies as input. We perform ten runs because we generate logical dependencies with different threshold values for the strength filter. We start with a threshold of 10 and increase it in steps of 10 up to 100, where 100 is the maximum value for the threshold.

In the third scenario, we combine logical with structural dependencies. Similar to the second scenario, we ran the tool ten times using structural and logical dependencies generated with different strength thresholds.

  \caption{Experimental scenarios for analyzing the impact of logical dependencies on clustering quality}
  \label{fig:scenatrio}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:results}

The experimental results are presented in this subsection in four tables, each corresponding to a different project. Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_ant} presents the results for Apache Ant, Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_tomcat} presents the results for Apache Tomcat, Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_hibernate} presents the results for Hibernate ORM, and Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_gson} presents the results for Gson \cite{cluster-access}.

Each table includes the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dependency Type:} The types of dependencies used are as follows: SD for Structural Dependencies, LD for Logical Dependencies, and SD+LD for their combination. The strength threshold used is specified in parentheses right after LD.
\item \textbf{Entities Count:} The total number of software entities (such as classes, interfaces, enums) involved in clustering.
\item \textbf{System Coverage:} Considering that the total number of entities extracted from the codebase — which represents the entities forming structural dependencies (SD) — constitutes the entire set of entities in the system (the first line of each table), we calculated the percentage of entities present in the filtered logical dependencies (LD) relative to the total number of known codebase entities.
\item \textbf{Louvain/ Leiden/ DBSCAN:} The clustering algorithms used in the experiments.
\item \textbf{Nr. of Clusters:} The number of clusters from the clustering solution.
\item \textbf{MQ (Modularization Quality):} The result obtained when applying the MQ evaluation metric to the clustering solution.
\item \textbf{MoJoFM:} The result obtained when applying the MoJoFM evaluation metric to the clustering solution.
\end{itemize}

The rows in each table represent different dependency types and strength filter thresholds used in the clustering experiments.

\caption{Average weights of Structural Dependencies (SD) and Logical Dependencies (LD).}
\label{tab:systems_weights}
\end{table}


To better understand the impact of different dependency types on software clustering, we also analyzed the average weights assigned to structural dependencies (SD) and logical dependencies (LD) across the studied projects. Table \ref{tab:systems_weights} presents these average dependency weights. The first row shows the average weights for SD, which remain constant across all strength thresholds, while the other rows show the average weights for logical dependencies at different strength thresholds.



\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\hspace{4em}The overall analysis of all the results from subsection \ref{subsec:results} indicates that combining structural and logical dependencies (SD+LD) provides better clustering solutions than using structural dependencies (SD) alone, covering 100\% of the system, meaning that no entity is missed during cluster generation. On the other hand, logical dependencies (LD) alone result in better clustering quality metrics compared to both SD and SD+LD, but they do not cover the entire system.

The best results for SD+LD are observed with a strength threshold between 10-40\%. For LD only, the best results are obtained at a 100\% strength threshold. The overall trend shows that for LD only, the MQ metric increases in value with a higher strength threshold, indicating more cohesive clusters, while the MoJo metric decreases, indicating that fewer transformations are needed to reach the expected clustering. For SD+LD, the best MQ and MoJo values are obtained at lower strength thresholds, and then both metrics indicate a less effective clustering solution obtained with higher strength thresholds.

We analyze each project in detail in the sections below and address the research questions.

\subsection{Detailed evaluation}

\subsubsection{Apache Ant}

\hspace{4em}The clustering results for Apache Ant (Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_ant}) show that the combined structural and logical dependencies (SD+LD) achieved the best values with a strength threshold between 10\% and 30\%. The highest value for the MQ metric is reached with Leiden at a strength threshold of 20\%, and the highest value for MoJoFM is also reached with Leiden at a strength threshold of 10\%.

Compared with the SD-only results, all SD+LD clustering solutions for all algorithms show better MQ metric values, with the highest MQ value for SD+LD being more than three times greater than the corresponding SD-only value. Similarly, the MoJoFM metric shows better results than SD-only. However, it does not always outperform the MoJoFM metric applied to SD-only data.

Logical dependencies (LD) alone produced the highest MQ and MoJoFM values at the 100\% strength threshold for both Leiden and Louvain, with the obtained metric values being higher than those of SD-only and SD+LD. However, the percentage of entities covered is significantly lower (LD(100) covers only 12.37\% of the system).
If we look at LD(10), where there is a 61.89\% coverage of the system, which is more compared to LD(100), both metrics still perform better than SD-only and SD+LD(10). However, there is still a gap until 100\% coverage.

From the clustering algorithm performance point of view, Leiden obtains the best evaluation metrics for all scenarios, followed by Louvain and DBSCAN.

One interesting observation is that, based on the LD-only results, where the metrics results improved with higher strength thresholds, the SD+LD results did not follow the same pattern. On the opposite, the SD+LD metric results decline with a higher strength threshold. An explanation for this behavior may lie in the overlap between structural and logical dependencies. As presented in Figure \ref{fig:ant_correlation}, the number of LD decreases with a stricter strength threshold compared to the number of SD, and the overlap between the two types of dependencies increases \cite{cluster-access}.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{ant_correlation.png}
\caption{Apache Ant: Overlap between structural and logical dependencies and its correlation with clustering metrics.}
\label{fig:ant_correlation}
\end{figure}

In our previous works, we studied how these two types of dependencies overlap \cite{b4}, \cite{DepSACI}. The reason behind those studies was to check how much new information we can get from using logical dependencies and how much is already present via structural dependencies.

Our overall findings were that with stricter filtering of logical dependencies, we obtain a higher percentage of overlap between the two dependencies, reaching at most 50\% of logical dependencies that are also structural dependencies.

So, we consider that the reason why SD+LD clustering solutions decline in performance with a higher strength threshold is that less and less new additional information is added to the system (logical dependencies that are not structural dependencies), causing the clustering solution to start resembling the performance of the SD-only solution. In Figure \ref{fig:ant_correlation}, we can see that LD(10) represents 61\% of the quantity of SD, while LD(100) is only at 12\%, with half of them being duplicated with SD.

\subsubsection{Apache Tomcat}

\hspace{4em}For Apache Tomcat (Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_tomcat}), the best results for SD+LD were obtained with strength thresholds between 10\% and 40\% across all algorithms. The Leiden algorithm achieved the best result for the MQ metric at a strength threshold of 40\%, while the best MoJoFM result was obtained at a threshold of 20\%, also with the Leiden algorithm. Compared with the SD-only results, the peak MQ values almost double the SD-only values. Like Apache Ant, the MQ values for all strength thresholds are higher than those for SD-only. While MoJoFM is not better for all thresholds, it still improves compared with the SD-only results.

The LD-only results show the highest MQ and MoJoFM values at LD(100) for the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. However, as with the Apache Ant results, coverage remains an issue. LD(100) covers only 16.62\% of the system, lower than the coverage from SD-only or SD+LD combinations. On the other hand, LD(10), which covers 61.33\% of the system, still has better clustering solutions compared to SD-only, based on both MQ and MoJoFM results.

We observe the same decline in results with a stricter strength threshold for SD+LD. As with the previous system, these results can again be connected to the percentage of LD that also overlaps with SD and the decreasing number of LD compared to SD once the strength threshold becomes stricter. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:catalina_correlation}, LD filtered with a 10\% strength threshold overlaps with SD by approximately 22\%, while at a 100\% strength threshold, the overlap increases to approximately 39\% \cite{cluster-access}.

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{catalina_correlation.png}
\caption{Apache Tomcat: Overlap between structural and logical dependencies and its correlation with clustering metrics.}
\label{fig:catalina_correlation}
\end{figure}

To ensure that the decline in performance for SD+LD with a stricter strength threshold is indeed caused by the fact that LD are significantly fewer than SD, and SD duplicates that part of them at higher thresholds, we added an additional experiment to our study. In this experiment, whose results can be found in Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_multiplication}, we increased the weights associated with LD(100) for Apache Tomcat to confirm that we are dealing with an LD quantity problem rather than a weight problem.

Therefore, in this experiment, we increased the weight assigned to each logical dependency filtered with a 100\% strength threshold from the Apache Tomcat system by values ranging from 1 to 5 and re-ran scenario III from Fig. \ref{fig:scenatrio}.


To maintain consistency, we used the same columns as in the other result tables (\ref{tab:clustering_results_ant}, \ref{tab:clustering_results_tomcat}, \ref{tab:clustering_results_hibernate}, \ref{tab:clustering_results_gson}), with the addition of two new columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiplication Factor:} The value by which each logical dependency weight is multiplied.
\item \textbf{Avg Weight:} The average weight assigned to each type of dependency used.
\end{itemize}

\end{table}


In Table \ref{tab:systems_weights}, which presents the average weights associated with the dependencies across all systems, we can see that for Tomcat, the average weight for LD(10) is already almost double the SD average weight. For LD(100), the average weight is approximately five times higher than that of SD.

Based on the metric values obtained for multiplication factors of 2 to 5, we can see that after increasing the weights assigned to LD, the metric values improve only slightly, with changes recorded at the second decimal: a 0.02 improvement for Louvain and 0.07 for Leiden. The results for DBSCAN remain unchanged due to the fixed values of MinPts and Eps and the already high LD weights for LD(100).

We can conclude from the experiment with weights that the issue is the quantity of dependencies. SD outnumbers LD, making LD information less impactful on the clustering solution.


\subsubsection{Hibernate ORM}

\hspace{4em}Hibernate ORM is the second largest system after Apache Tomcat regarding the number of commits analyzed, with 16,609 commits considered for LD extraction. Additionally, it is the largest in terms of system size, with 4,414 entities (Table \ref{tab:project_info}).

Based on the results from Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_hibernate}, the SD+LD combination with a strength threshold of 40 performs best for this system. Louvain achieves the best MQ metric at this threshold, while Leiden achieves the best MoJoFM metric.

LD-only produced the best MQ values at 100\% strength and the best MoJoFM values at 70\% strength for both Louvain and Leiden. Compared to the previous systems, where both best values were recorded at the same strength threshold, Hibernate shows an earlier peak for MoJoFM. The system coverage is likely a factor contributing to this. Hibernate  LD[100] covers only 8.07\% of the system, the lowest percentage among all systems studied. This low percentage can be linked to the number of commits compared to the number of entities. For Apache Tomcat, there were 22,698 commits and 662 entities, while for Hibernate, there were 16,609 commits and 4,414 entities. This indicates that not all entities had a chance to be updated in the version control system.

This observation is also reflected in Table \ref{tab:systems_weights}, where Hibernate has the lowest average weights for LD compared to SD across all systems. In other systems, LD(10) starts with almost double the average weight compared to SD, while Hibernate's LD(10) average weight is less than half of the SD average weight.

  \caption{Hibernate ORM: Overlap between structural and logical dependencies and its correlation with clustering metrics.}
  \label{fig:hibernate_correlation}
\end{figure}

Hibernate has the lowest overlap percentage between LD and SD, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hibernate_correlation}. Similar to the other systems, the performance for MQ and MoJoFM decreases for SD+LD as the strength threshold becomes stricter.

The results for Hibernate highlight the challenge of achieving better clustering in larger systems with fewer commits relative to their size \cite{cluster-access}.


\subsubsection{Google Gson}


\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{gson_correlation.png}
  \caption{Google Gson: Overlap between structural and logical dependencies and its correlation with clustering metrics.}
  \label{fig:gson_correlation}
\end{figure}

\hspace{4em}Gson has the smallest number of commits analyzed, with 1,772 commits considered for LD extraction, and it is also the smallest in terms of system size, with 210 entities involved in clustering (Table \ref{tab:project_info}).

Based on the results from Table \ref{tab:clustering_results_gson}, the SD+LD combination with a strength threshold of 10 achieved the best results for both MQ and MoJoFM. Like Apache Ant and Tomcat, all SD+LD combinations achieve better MQ values than SD-only.

LD-only produced the best results for MQ at 40\% strength for both Louvain and Leiden, and the best MoJoFM value was also observed at the same threshold for both algorithms. It is the only system where the best MQ result for LD-only occurs at a lower strength threshold than 100\%. This is due to the very low number of entities remaining in the system at 100\% (only 18 out of 210).

In this particular system, it is more visible that the Leiden clustering algorithm does not improve the Louvain algorithm in some scenarios. This observation is based on the fact that the values obtained for both MQ and MoJoFM metrics are the same in most cases for the Gson system for both algorithms.

It can also be observed that Gson has identical metric values for MQ and MoJoFM across multiple strength thresholds. Again, the small number of commits and the size of the system contribute to the stability of these metrics.

Gson also has relatively high overlap rates between LD and SD compared to the other systems, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gson_correlation}. Despite the constant values, the trend of decreasing performance for SD+LD with stricter strength filtering for LD is also present in Gson.

The results for this system highlight the difficulty of achieving better clustering solutions using logical dependencies in smaller systems with fewer commits. However, even for a small system like Gson, an improvement is still visible when using logical dependencies.


\subsection{Manual inspection for Ant clustering}
\label{discussion_ant}

\hspace{4em}Beyond the positive result indicated by the MQ metric, we searched for further validation by human software engineering expert opinion. After studying and understanding the analyzed system source code and documentation, we evaluated the remodularization proposals resulting from the two clustering solutions.

The two clustering solutions compared are the clustering solution obtained only from structural dependencies, in comparison to the clustering solution obtained from using both structural and logical dependencies, filtered with a threshold of 30\% for strength.

The clustering solution relying solely on structural dependencies consists of 12 clusters, while the solution using both structural and logical dependencies consists of 15 clusters. Both solutions involve the same number of entities (517). The entities listed below are placed in different clusters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item taskdefs.Available\$FileDir
    \item taskdefs.Concat and its inner classes taskdefs.Concat\$1, taskdefs.Concat\$MultiReader, taskdefs.Concat\$ TextElement
    \item taskdefs.Javadoc\$AccessType
    \item util.WeakishReference and its inner class util.WeakishReference\$HardReference
    \item taskdefs.Replace and its inner classes taskdefs.Replace\$ NestedString, taskdefs.Replace\$Replacefilter
\end{itemize}

The migration of entities between clusters is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:clustersmigration}. Given that the inner classes are shifted from one cluster to another in the same way as the outer class, we omitted the inner classes from the diagram.

As the cluster number itself is not significant and may vary across different script runs (labels might vary), we will refer to each individual cluster resulting from structural dependencies as \textit{Cluster A} and to the ones resulting from both logical and structural dependencies as \textit{Cluster B}.

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{clusters.png}
\caption{Migration of entities between clusters}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{taskdefs.Concat and its inner classes}

\hspace{4em}To have a better overview of how and why entities are transferred between clusters, we depicted Concat's logical and structural connections in Figure \ref{fig:dep_concat}. Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:clusterAconcat} illustrates connections within Cluster A, while Figure \ref{fig:clusterBconcat} does the same for Cluster B.

In Cluster A, the Concat class and its inner classes (Concat\$1, Concat\$MultiReader, Concat\$TextElement) are placed together with conditions like Available, And, Or, IsTrue, Equals, IsReference, Contains.

On the other hand, in Cluster B, they are placed with classes associated with file manipulation and archive operations such as Ear, Jar, War, and Zip, as well as utility classes for file handling like FileUtils and JavaEnvUtils, and entities for zip file processing (ZipEntry, ZipFile). This placement is due to the logical dependencies that Concat class has with FileUtils and FileSet in the versioning system.

To assess whether the placement of Concat in Cluster B is better than in Cluster A, we referred to the official Ant documentation. According to the documentation: "This class contains the 'concat' task, used to concatenate a series of files into a single stream" \cite{ant_concat}. Therefore, judging by its usage and purpose according to the documentation, positioning the Concat class along with its inner classes in Cluster B is more suitable than in Cluster A.

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cluster_concatSDLD.PNG}
\caption{Placement of Concat in ClusterB (SD and LD); cluster size: 52}
\label{fig:clusterBconcat}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{taskdefs.Available\$FileDir}

\hspace{4em}In Cluster A the entity 'taskdefs.Available\$FileDir' is in the same cluster with entities that are related to the build process (ProjectHelper, TaskAdapter, ComponentHelper), but not with entities that have any relation to condition checks or file existence evaluations or with its outer class. 

Cluster B contains entities that are related to condition checking (And, Contains, Equals, Or, UpToDate), and also with the outer class of 'taskdefs.Available\$FileDir',  'taskdefs.Available'. The movement of entities from Cluster A to Cluster B was influenced by the logical dependencies between 'taskdefs.Available' and 'taskdefs.Available\$FileDir'.

The documentation description for 'taskdefs.Available' states: "Will set the given property if the requested resource is available at runtime. This task may also be used as a condition by the condition task."\cite{ant_concat}.
This reinforces its placement in Cluster B, which is centered around task definitions and conditions related to build processes.



\subsubsection{ taskdefs.Replace and its inner classes}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{dep_replace.png}
\caption{Ant dependencies (LD and SD) of Replace and its inner classes}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cluster_replaceSDLD.PNG}
\caption{Placement of Replace in ClusterB (SD and LD); cluster size: 42}
\label{fig:clusterBreplace}

\end{figure}


\hspace{4em}We depicted the logical and structural connections of Replace in Figure \ref{fig:dep_replace}. Figure \ref{fig:clusterAreplace} illustrates connections within Cluster A, while Figure \ref{fig:clusterBreplace} does the same for Cluster B.

Replace and its inner classes are placed in Cluster B with entities with which they share common functionality and purpose, such as Copydir, Delete, DependSet, or MatchingTask. These entities are involved in similar tasks and operations. On the other hand, the placement in Cluster A, with WeakishReference and its inner class doesn't seem good, as these entities are completly unrelated.  

The movement of entities from Cluster A to Cluster B was influenced by the strong logical dependency between 'taskdefs.Replace' and 'taskdefs.MatchingTask'.

The cluster from figure \ref{fig:clusterAreplace} is the 12th cluster from the clustering solution based on structural dependencies. This particular cluster is essentially comprised of two unrelated entities: Replace and WeakishReference. Due to their logical dependencies, both entities are grouped within larger clusters that share similar functionalities in the SD and LD solution \cite{icstcc-2024}.


\subsection{Research questions and findings}

\hspace{4em}In this section, we will answer our research questions based on the results of our experiments. 

\textit{ \textbf{RQ1:} Does using structural dependencies (SD) combined with logical dependencies (LD) improve software clustering results compared to traditional approaches using only structural dependencies (SD)?} 

Based on the results from all four systems analyzed, the combination of SD and LD performed better than SD-only according to the MQ and MoJoFM metrics, confirming that using SD+LD improves software clustering results. Across different strength thresholds, SD+LD achieved higher MQ and MoJoFM values for all clustering algorithms, indicating better modularization. 
The filtering thresholds applied to logical dependencies influence the effectiveness of combining SD and LD. Lower strength thresholds (10\% to 40\%) resulted in better MQ and MoJoFM values across all clustering algorithms compared with higher thresholds.

At higher strength thresholds, the MQ and MoJoFM results decline. This decline occurs because stricter strength thresholds significantly reduce the amount of logical dependencies. This reduction leads to fewer new relationships introduced into the clustering process. Our previous research on the overlap between SD and LD showed that higher strength thresholds correlate with increased overlap between the two dependencies. This overlap indicates that at higher strength thresholds, not much new information is added to the system besides what is already introduced by structural dependencies, reducing the impact of logical dependencies on clustering results.

However, when considering a lower strength threshold, the relationship between the system size and the number of commits in the version history becomes an important factor.

In the case of Hibernate, a stricter strength threshold was needed to achieve the best metric values compared to other systems. Although the metrics obtained at a 10\% strength threshold for LD are better than SD-only, the system reached peak metric values at 40\% threshold across all algorithms.

With 16,609 commits and 4,414 entities, Hibernate has a significantly lower average number of commits per entity than Ant (14,917 commits and 517 entities) or Tomcat (22,698 commits and 662 entities). This lower ratio means that each entity in Hibernate is, on average, involved in fewer commits. As a result, the co-change data extracted for logical dependencies are sparser and contain more noise at lower strength thresholds.

A stricter strength threshold (e.g., 40\%) filters out these weaker logical dependencies.

In contrast, systems like Ant and Tomcat, with higher ratios of commits to entities, obtain better results with logical dependencies at a 10\% strength threshold because entities participate in more commits on average.

In conclusion, with an appropriate threshold, combining SD with LD leads to better clustering results than using SD alone.


\textit{\textbf{RQ2:} Can using only logical dependencies (LD) produce good software clustering results?} 

Using LD-only produced good clustering results, especially at higher strength thresholds. LD(100) produced the highest MQ and MoJoFM values for most systems compared with SD-only and SD+LD. However, the coverage of LD-only is significantly lower at these higher thresholds. For all systems, after filtering with 100\% strength threshold, the system coverage of the remaining logical dependencies is less than 17\% of the total known dependencies in the system.

Thus, while LD(100) provides the highest metric results compared to SD+LD and SD-only, it represents only a small subset of the system's dependencies.

On the other hand, LD(10) has, in most of the cases, better metric results than those for SD-only and SD+LD with better system coverage. Apache Ant and Tomcat LD(10) cover more than 60\% of the system, while for Hibernate and Gson, the coverage is slightly above 30\%. 

Therefore, LD(10) can be an alternative to SD-only or SD+LD, especially if structural dependencies are not available.

It is also important to consider that LD-only performance at higher strength thresholds depends on the system's characteristics, such as the number of commits and entities. For Gson project, the performance at a 100\% strength threshold is not as good as for the other systems, reaching its peak at a 40\% threshold. This is due to the low number of entities remaining at higher thresholds, with only 18 entities at the 80\% to 100\% strength thresholds, and the relatively small number of commits considered.

In summary, while LD-only can produce good clustering results, especially at higher strength thresholds, its limited coverage reduces its usability, as the clustering is intended for the entire system, not just a small subset. LD-only offers a good alternative to SD-only at lower strength thresholds, providing acceptable coverage.

\textit{ \textbf{RQ3:} How do different filtering settings for logical dependencies (LD) impact clustering results, and which filtering settings provide the best performance?}

The impact of different filtering settings on clustering performance was observed across all systems. For LD-only clustering, lower strength thresholds like 10\% provided good system coverage but had lower MQ and MoJoFM values compared to higher thresholds like 100\%, where the best metric results were often achieved. However, at these higher thresholds, the system coverage was significantly reduced.

The best performance was generally observed with strength thresholds between 10\% and 40\% for the combination of SD and LD (SD+LD). At these thresholds, the clustering solutions achieved higher MQ and MoJoFM values than SD alone.

It is important to select the optimal filtering threshold. Logical dependencies filtered with lower strength thresholds include more relationships, introducing more knowledge that could improve clustering results. However, a too-low threshold may sometimes introduce noise, especially in systems with a low commits-to-entities ratio. On the other hand, higher thresholds significantly reduce noise but can exclude valuable dependencies and decrease coverage.

The optimal filtering threshold may vary depending on system characteristics ( number of commits, size of the system), so it is important to consider these factors when filtering logical dependencies \cite{cluster-access}.

\section{Chapter conclusions}
\label{sec:clustering_class_conclusions}

\hspace{4em}Our findings indicate that using logical dependencies improves software clustering. Integrating LD with SD achieved higher MQ and MoJoFM values across all clustering algorithms and projects than the SD-only approach, demonstrating enhanced clustering due to the additional information provided by logical dependencies.

Using logical dependencies alone resulted in the highest MQ and MoJoFM values compared to SD-only and SD+LD combinations. However, these strength thresholds corresponded to low system coverage, meaning that a significant portion of software entities was excluded from the clustering process. This suggests that logical dependencies alone may not be sufficient if full system coverage is required.

The impact of using logical dependencies is influenced by the filtering thresholds applied during their extraction. Lower strength thresholds (10\% to 40\%) provided a good trade-off between including meaningful co-change relationships and minimizing noise. At these thresholds, the combined SD+LD approach outperformed the SD-only approach. At higher strength thresholds (e.g., 100\%), the reduced coverage and increased overlap between LD and SD minimized the advantages of using logical dependencies.

This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate filtering thresholds for logical dependencies. The strength filtering threshold should be selected based on the characteristics of the software system, such as system size and commit history so that users can benefit from logical dependencies to improve architectural reconstruction.

In conclusion, when optimally filtered and combined with structural dependencies, logical dependencies enhance software clustering results and provide full system coverage. In cases where structural dependencies are unavailable, logical dependencies alone offer a viable alternative \cite{cluster-access}.
